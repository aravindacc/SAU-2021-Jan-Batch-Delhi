                <p class="sidebar-text" style="border-style: outset ; padding: 1.1em">"Simplicity requires a two-step process. 
                    First, we must invest time and energy to discover what stirs us as human beings, what makes our hearts sing, and what brings us joy. 
                    Then, we must proceed to create the life that reflects the unique people we truly are. 
                    This is the heart and soul of simplicity." - By Linda Breen Pierce</p>

                <p class="para"> <img class="wrapingimage" src="funfact1.jpg" title="Funfact 1" style=" width: 60%;">The world's total population is more than 7.5 billion. And obviously, that number sounds huge. However, 
                    it might feel a little more manageable once you learn that if every single one of those people stood shoulder-to-shoulder, 
                    they could all fit within the 500 square miles of Los Angeles, according to National Geographic.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="funfact-style" >Fact: Johnny Appleseed’s fruits weren’t for eating</p>
                <p class="para">Yes, there was a real John Chapman who planted thousands of apple trees on U.S. soil.
                     But the apples on those trees were much more bitter than the ones you’d find in the supermarket today.
                     “Johnny Appleseed” didn’t expect his fruits to be eaten whole, but rather made into hard apple cider.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="funfact-style" >Fact: The hottest chili pepper in the world is so hot it could kill you.</p>
                <p class="para">The "weapons-grade" Dragon's Breath chili pepper is so hot it's downright deadly. If you ate one, it could potentially cause a type of anaphylactic shock, burning the airways and closing them up.

                    "I've tried it on the tip of my tongue and it just burned and burned," said Mike Smith, the hobby grower who invented the Dragon's Breath along with scientists from Nottingham University. So why make such an impractical pepper? 
                    As it turns out, the chili was initially developed to be used in medical treatment as an anesthetic that can numb the skin.</p>

                <p class="para1"  >Mobileye uses a camera-based system that helps cars with adaptive cruise control and lane-change assistance.</p>
                <p class="sidebar-text" style="border-style: outset ; padding: 1.1em">The head of Intel's self-driving car subsidiary said on Tuesday the company wants to shift toward using its own radar-based technology and use a single LiDAR sensor per vehicle by 2025 in a bid to lower the cost of autonomous driving.

                    Mobileye has taken a different strategy from many of its self-driving car competitors, with a current camera-based system that helps cars with adaptive cruise control and lane change assistance. <br>
                    <img class="wrapingimage" src="techSidebar.gif" title="Intel Cars" style="height: 68%; width: 62%;" >Those systems are on the road today and are gathering data to help Mobileye map the roads in new cities.
                    
                    For more advanced systems, the company plans to add both radar sensors, which use radio waves to detect distance from objects, and LiDAR, a laser-based system that helps self-driving vehicles gain a three-dimensional view of the road. 
                    For a planned fleet of so-called robotaxis, which are commercial vehicles meant to ferry around passengers, the company is tapping sensors from Luminar Technologies.</p>

                        <p class="written-by">By Nelson Graves | 11 Jan 2021 | Americas, Eyewitness, Government, Joe Biden, News Decoder Updates</p>

                        <p class="para">News Decoder correspondent Gene Gibbons covered six U.S. presidents. His White House memoir offers portraits of presidents, a queen and a pope. He covered six U.S. presidents as a White House correspondent, and now he has written a memoir that offers an inside look at modern American history and portraits of presidents, a queen and a pope.

                            News Decoder correspondent Gene Gibbons has distilled three decades of reporting from the White House into a 260-page book, “Breaking News: A Life in Journalism,” which is available on Amazon and Barnes & Noble.
                            
                            “The memoir of a longtime Reuters White House Correspondent, this book is loaded with stories about presidents and other U.S. political figures, the Queen of England and a sainted Pope,” according to the summary on Amazon.
                            
                            <br><br>Gibbons reported from the White House first with United Press International, then Reuters, and covered Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.
                            
                            He had an insider’s view of Watergate, the end of the Vietnam War, two global oil crises, the Iran hostage crisis, the Iran-Contra scandal and Clinton’s impeachment. 
                           Presidents, a queen and a sainted pope are featured in the memoir.

                            News-Decoder founder Nelson Graves is at the Eurasian Media Forum in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Today Graves held a masterclass on Environmental Journalism. 
                            His main message was that while climate change poses immense problems for the world, it also offers huge opportunities for positive change, led by youth.
                            Gibbons recently wrote about attending elementary school with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, concluding that the former vice president will be a caring leader as president.
                            I asked Gibbons what message his book has for young people around the world. “There’s no substitute for old fashioned shoe leather journalism — gathering as much information from as many sources as possible, 
                            subjecting it to dogged fact-checking and reporting it with scrupulous honesty,” he said.<br><br>
                            It started with a realization during a family holiday two years ago. Our children, in their 20s, were up to speed on international headlines even during vacation thanks to smartphones.
                            But questions kept coming. Why is there fighting in Syria? Flooding in India but drought in the U.S.? Why care about Iran's new president?

                    <p class="written-by">By Written by Kanishka Sarkar, Hindustan Times, New Delhi</p>

                    <p class="para"  style="border-right-style: solid; padding: 1.1em">On the day his ‘kisan mahapanchayat’ programme in Karnal had to be cancelled after protesting farmers uprooted tents and damaged the stage at the venue, 
                        Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the Centre was not likely to repeal the three farm laws. 
                        “Discussion can be held on certain points, but I do not think government is going to withdraw these laws,” he said.<br> <br>
                        Hours after the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of three contentious farm laws enacted by the Centre in September, 
                        Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Tuesday met home minister Amit Shah. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders discussed the law and 
                        order situation as Haryana is the “epicentre of farmers’ stir,” Khattar said after the meeting, according to news agency PTI.

                        “Today, the Supreme Court stayed the farm laws and formed a committee. All these were discussed (during the meeting with Amit Shah). 
                        Events on January 26 should go well as it's a national festival. Farmers assured in their press conference that it'll be peaceful. 
                        It's being hoped that they'll call off agitation and go back home,” Haryana chief minister told news agency ANI after the meeting.
                        The remark came after Congress on Monday demanded that Haryana chief minister resign as he has "lost the faith of the people" and the moral authority to rule after farmers did not allow his chopper to land during an event in Karnal.
                        The protesting farmers, however, have refused to call off the demonstrations, till the three agricultural legislations are repealed. 
                        They said they won't accept any committee formed by the apex court to end the impasse between the government and the protesters as “the members of the committee are pro-government.”

                    <p class="written-by">By Written by Raghav Sen, Hindustan Times, New Delhi</p>

                    <p class="para">People would not have the option of making a choice between the two available COVID-19 vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin – when the rollout starts on January 16, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a press conference on Tuesday.

                        The Union government, he said, had agreed to procure 110 lakh Covishield doses from the Serum Institute of India (SII) at ₹200/dose and 55 lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech (BBIL), of which 38.5 lakh doses is priced at ₹295/dose.
                        
                        Four other COVID-19 vaccines were under trial currently in the country and that it had so far received “54,72,000 doses of the vaccine to be distributed, while 100% doses to be received by 14th Jan in all States/UTs’’.
                        
                        ‘Encouraging environment’
                        “Our expectations from the States/UTs is that all logistics should be ready from January 16 and there should be continuous oversight and personal involvement in the entire process of roll-out. 
                        Also, there should be special focus on communication activities and utilisation of all types of channels to create an encouraging environment,” said Mr. Bhushan.
                        <br>
                        <br><img class="wrapingimage" src="news3.jpg" title="Coronavirus" class="center">Member (Health) Niti Aayog Dr. V.K. Paul said the two vaccines available in India were safe and that there should not be any doubt about this.

                        “They have been tested on thousands of people and the side-effects are negligible. All the vaccines in the world used currently against COVID-19 have been cleared under the emergency-use framework. As we go ahead, we will have more options. 
                        India has also been able to get these vaccines at very competitive prices,’’ he stated.
                        
                        Mr. Bhushan noted that the situation was worrisome across the world with cases graphs still climbing in the U.S., the U.K., Brazil and South Africa. 
                        “In India, 12,584 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours and active cases continue to decline and it is now less than 2.2 lakh. 
                        Only two States currently have more than 50,000 active cases – Maharashtra and Kerala,’’ he added.</p>

                     India-US cooperation to “preserve maritime security and counter Chinese influence in South and Southeast Asia and other regions of mutual concern”</p>
                <p class="para" style="border-left-style: solid; padding: 1.1em">The strategy, framed more than two years before the India-China military standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), makes more than 20 mentions of India and sees the country as “preeminent in South Asia” and taking on “the leading role in 
                    maintaining Indian Ocean security” while increasing engagement with Southeast Asia and expanding economic and defence cooperation with other US allies and partners.
                    On the other hand, the document, classified “secret” and “not for foreign nationals”, sees China as a strategic competitor to the US intent on dissolving American alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific and circumventing “international rules and norms to gain an advantage”. 
                    It also states China will use its dominance in cutting edge technologies to “pose profound challenges to free societies”.
                    The strategy is based on the assumption that a “strong India, in cooperation with like-minded countries, would act as a counterbalance to China”, 
                    and that New Delhi’s “preferred partner on security issues” is Washington.</p>

                     He is the senior-most Indian leader to address the UNSC since India joined the powerful 15-member UN body as a non-permanent member this month for a two-year tenure.

                    "Some states lack legal and operational frameworks and technical expertise to detect, investigate and prosecute terrorist financing cases. 
                    However, there are other states that are guilty of aiding and supporting terrorism and provide financial assistance and safe havens," said Jaishankar.
                    "We must summon political will to combat terrorism. There must be no ifs and buts in the fight. Nor should we allow terrorism to be justified and terrorists glorified. 
                    All members must fulfill the obligations enshrined in international counter-terrorism instruments," he said.

                    Referring to Dawood Ibrahim, in hiding in Pakistan, Jaishankar said: "We have seen crime syndicate responsible for 1993 Mumbai blasts not just given state protection but enjoying five-star hospitality."
                     Last August, Pakistan had for the first time acknowledged the presence of Ibrahim on its soil after 
                    the government imposed sweeping sanctions on 88 banned terror groups and their leaders which also included the name of the underworld don wanted by India.
