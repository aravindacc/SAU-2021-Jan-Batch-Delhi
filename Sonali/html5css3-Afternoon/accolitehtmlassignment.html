The inner walls of the temple sanctum are adorned with figures of various deities and scenes from mythology. According to legends, the Pandavas sought the blessings of lord Shiva to atone their sin after the battle of Mahabharata. Lord Shiva eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull. On being followed, he dived into ground leaving behind his hump on the surface. Outside the temple door a large statue of the Nandi Bull stands as guard.. It is at this time, that the doors of the temple are thrown open to pilgrims, who flock from all parts of India,
                         for a holy pilgrimage.Kedarnath is amongst the holiest pilgrimages for the devout Hindu. It is set amidst the stunning mountainscape of the Garhwal Himalayas at the head of the Mandakini River. </p></div>
