	    <p class = "textstyle" >Clients’ demands for a digital overhaul of their businesses – to mitigate disruptions of the kind they suffered during the pandemic – is leading to a surge in orders for Indian IT services companies. It’s also enabling the latter to quickly lift themselves from the early pandemic lows.</p>



		<p class = "textstyle">In a seasonally weak quarter, which is marked by the holiday season and furloughs, Infosys grew by 5.3% sequentially, while Wipro grew by 3.4%, which nearly met the top end of its revenue guidance for the quarter. Year-on-year growth rates are significantly better than in the first two quarters, and look to be fast heading towards pre-Covid levels.</p>

		
	      <blockquote>
	        “We are ready to participate in all these (large deals) and have our capabilities ready. The large deal wins give us confidence for the quarter ahead,” Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, who completed three years at the helm, said.

		    <p  class = "textstyle">According to data analytics company Airfinity, the US has the capability to produce almost 4.7 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses up until the end of 2021. India also has a high capability to produce the vaccine at more than 3 billion possible doses, according to the findings published by Deutsche Welle.</p>
		    
		    <p class = "textstyle">India is home to the largest vaccine manufacturer in the world, the Serum Institute of India. The company produces almost 1.4 billion doses annually, as per 2015 figures which are the latest available. In comparison, the same report by the Access to Medicine Foundation showed that Sanofi produced 1 billion vaccine doses that same year while GlaxoSmithKline made almost 700 million.</p>

		    <p class = "textstyle">Pfizer kept their numbers confidential. Despite the high number of doses, the Serum Institute earned far less with their vaccines due to the fact that most of them are sold at a low price domestically. In 2015, the company had revenues of just approximately $566 million, while Sanofi and Pfizer made between 35 and almost 50 billion, respectively.</p>

		<p class = "rowtextstyle">
		Kerala's 37-year-old pacer Sreesanth gave Mumbai's 19-year-old opener Yashasvi Jaiswal a 'death stare' after the latter came down the pitch and missed a delivery during their Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match. Sreesanth was seen going close to the batsman and staring at him before going back to run-up. Jaiswal went on to hit two sixes off Sreesanth's next two deliveries.</p>
		<p class = "rowtextstyle">
			There was a mini duel that took place in the match between Kerala and Mumbai on January 13th, 2021. 19-year-old Yashasvi Jaiswal got the better of Sreesanth, a man who is almost double his age. Off the first ball of the 6th over in the Mumbai innings, Sreesanth bowled a length delivery just outside off stump. Jaiswal went for a big heave but failed to make any connection. Sreesanth went and had a small ‘chat’ with the young left-hander after the delivery. Jaiswal’s reply would have definitely rattled the veteran pacer. Off the next delivery bowled by Sreesanth, Jaiswal cleared his front leg out of the way and smashed the ball into orbit.

		<p class = "rowtextstyle">

		The fourth Australia-India Test will take place at the Gabba from tomorrow. Australia haven't lost a single Test at the stadium since November 1988.

		<p class = "rowtextstyle">
			While India's bowling attack has been weakened by injuries to the likes of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja, Australia are likely to go with a full-title bowling attack, retaining their pace trio of Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon despite the workload over the last 3 Tests. If Bumrah is not available, India will field a pace attack in which none of the pacers have played more than 2 Tests.
