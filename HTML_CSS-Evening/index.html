                            <p><b>Tesla Inc has moved a step closer to its launch in India later this year by registering a company in the country, a regulatory filing showed on Tuesday.</b></p>

                            <p>Tesla Motors India and Energy Private Limited was incorporated on January 8 with its registered office in the southern city of Bengaluru, a hub for several global technology companies.</p>

                            <p>The filing shows the Indian unit has three directors including David Feinstein, who is currently a senior executive at Tesla, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p>

                            <p>India’s transport minister Nitin Gadkari told a local newspaper in December that the United States electric carmaker would start with sales and then might look at assembly and manufacturing.</p>

                            <p>Tesla chief executive Elon Musk has tweeted several times in recent years, including as recently as October 2020, about an impending foray into India.</p>

                            <p>The move comes as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is promoting the production and use of electric vehicles to reduce the country’s oil dependence and cut down on pollution.</p>

                            <p>But efforts have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations.</p>

                                <p>It was clear communication between the two that both R Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari singled out as the backbone of their record stonewalling effort that denied Australia the Test victory in Sydney and the series lead.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p>Although their alliance was only 62 runs, Ashwin and Vihari battled for 256 deliveries, the fourth-longest partnership recorded for the sixth wicket in the fourth innings of a Test in a win or a draw. Both players faced equal number of deliveries, 128, and the vigil earned Ashwin the honour of being ranked fifth on the list of most balls faced by an India No. 7 in the fourth innings.</p>

                        "So we urge people to keep following COVID appropriate behaviour," he said. Bhushan said there will be a gap of 28 days between two doses of COVID-19 vaccine and that people won't be given a choice on which vaccine to take.</p>

                        <p>"In many countries, more than one vaccine is being used. There is no such option available to any of the beneficiaries in these countries," said Bhushan when asked if the states and the beneficiaries will have a choice between Covaxin and Covishield India will launch its COVID-19 vaccination drive from January 16 with priority to be given to nearly three crore healthcare and frontline workers.</p>
