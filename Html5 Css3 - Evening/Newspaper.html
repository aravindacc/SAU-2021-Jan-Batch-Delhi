                    With the government rolling out the much-awaited COVID-19 vaccination drive across India from January 16, here is an explainer that clears some basic doubts on how to register, 
                    who will get the vaccine first, safety and privacy, and whether vaccine interchangeability is allowed.

                    <b>Who would get the vaccine first?</b>
                    <br>
                    The vaccine rollout will be in a phased manner. In the initial phase, the government said it would inoculate about one crore healthcare workers. This will be followed by two crore frontline workers, police, armed forces, municipal workers, revenue staff and others. In the third phase, 27 crore people above 50 years of age and those with co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension, and organ transplant patients will get the vaccine. Then the government may give open access via the private market to healthy adults, teenagers, children and lastly to neonates. 
                    The central government will be footing the bill for vaccinating three crore healthcare and frontline workers.

                        Kim Jong Un has rolled out a lot of new missiles in recent months, including at least one more this week.
                        The next step is for him to fire them into the air to get President-elect Joe Biden’s attention.
                        The North Korean leader paraded a new submarine-launched ballistic missile through central Pyongyang Thursday as part of a military pageant to mark the completion of more than a week of ruling party meetings. 
                        The Pukguksong-5 -- the largest in an growing line of solid-fueled nuclear missiles -- moves Kim closer to a opening a maritime front in his strategic struggle with the US.

                        The industries and industrial associations should do more research to identify these substitutes to curb imports, he added.
                        Instead of importing spare part, the industry should help their vendors to find an indigenous replacement, Gadkari said in a virtual meeting on Friday.
