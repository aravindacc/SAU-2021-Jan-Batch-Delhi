In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea.[28] The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn.[29] The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope.[25][30] Dorothy Hamre[31] and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students in 1962. They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, designating it 229E. The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether.[32] Transmission electron micrograph of organ cultured coronavirus OC43 Scottish virologist June Almeida at St. Thomas Hospital in London, collaborating with Tyrrell, compared the structures of IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967.[33][34] Using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club-like spikes.[35] A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples OC43 (OC for organ culture).[36] Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.[37][38] The IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus.[20] This new group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance.[8] Human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades.[39][40] The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present human coronavirus it was.[41] Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003, HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.[42] There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.[43] Microbiology\"))));\n};\n\nvar styles = StyleSheet.create({\n  shadow: {\n

They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, designating it 229E. The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether.[32]\n                            Transmission electron micrograph of organ cultured coronavirus OC43\n                            Scottish virologist June Almeida at St. Thomas Hospital in London, collaborating with Tyrrell, compared the structures of IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967.[33][34] Using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club-like spikes.[35] A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples OC43 (OC for organ culture).[36] Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.[37][38]\n                            The IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus.[20] This new group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance.[8] Human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades.[39][40] The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present human coronavirus it was.[41] Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003, HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019.[42] There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.[43]\n                            Microbiology\n                        </Text>\n                    </View>\n                </View>\n\n            </View>\n\n        );\n    \n}\n\nconst styles = StyleSheet.create({\n    shadow: {\n        backgroundColor:\"#000000\",\n        flex:1\n    },\n    centeredView: {\n      flex: 1,\n      justifyContent: \"center\",\n      alignItems: \"center\",\n      marginTop: 25\n    },\n   \n    openButton: {\n      backgroundColor: \"#F194FF\",\n      borderRadius: 30,\n      padding: 15,\n      elevation: 3\n    },\n    modalText: {\n      marginBottom: 20,\n      textAlign: \"center\"\n    }\n  });\n  \n\nexport default CountryCoronaDetail;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
