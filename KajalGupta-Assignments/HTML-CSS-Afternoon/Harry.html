			<h2 class="headline">The Boy Who Lived</h2>
			<p>Voldemort heard a partial prophecy about the birth of a person who could kill him. He apparently searched among the ranks of those who opposed him and decided that a 1 year old boy named Harry Potter fit the conditions the prophecy mentioned (at least the ones that Snape was able to overhear). The boy and his family were in hiding, but luckily their Secret Keeper was secretly one of Voldemort’s followers and was able to betray their location to him. Everything lined up so that Voldemort could eliminate the threat, since Voldemort did not want to be killed or defeated. Once all those things were in place, Voldemort chose to take care of the threat to himself immediately, without waiting. On Halloween night 1981, he attacked the Potter family, killed the parents, and was in turn destroyed by the rebounding of his own killing curse on the baby.</p>
			<p>Harry later asked Dumbledore why Voldemort didn’t wait to see which of the kids that met the prophecy’s conditions appeared more dangerous as they grew up. Dumbledore tells him that that would have been better, but since Snape did not hear and relay the entire prophecy, Voldemort wouldn’t have known that. So he made the best choice he could.</p>

				Voldemort was many things bad, but he also was a man of action. Rather than wait, he wanted to take care of any threats to himself immediately. And so he tried to kill Harry, even though he was at the time only a defenseless baby. But in Voldemort’s eyes, that wouldn’t have mattered. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Harry might have been a baby right now, but later, somehow, he was going to be a threat. Since Voldemort had no moral qualms about killing anyone, let alone a baby, he took immediate action.

			<h2 class="headline">The Dark Lord Defeated</h2>
			<p><i>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...."</i>

				— Sybill Trelawney's prophecy made to Albus Dumbledore</p>
			<p>This prophecy foretold that either Harry or Neville had the power to vanquish the Dark Lord, or be his equal. This gave Voldemort a choice, and when he decided on Harry, he tried and failed to kill him multiple times. Choosing Harry as the one with more threat; making him the Chosen One, took Neville out of the equation entirely.</p>
			<p>The reason that Voldemort failed to kill Harry was because of the act of love his mother gave for him when dying. However, the line in the prophecy: Neither can live while the other survives, was not heard by Voldemort, as Snape only heard and relayed half the prophecy. Because of his mother’s love, Harry grew up alive and was able to become Voldemort’s equal and eventually vanquish him.</p>

			<h2 class="headline">Nothing To Fear</h2>
			<p>Durig the first reign of the dark Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore no only had to run his school but manage the Order Of the Phoenix, which was designed to resist voldemort’s Reign of terror.

				During this time he interviewed a woman called Sibyll Trelawney for a position at Hogwarts, who made a prophecy regarding Voldemort’s downfall at the hands of a child born in July. In that pub however, Severus Snape, who was a Death Eater at the time, overheard the prophecy and told his master, Voldemort. This led to Voldemort deciding to go after those to whom the prophecy pertained. Either Neville Longbottom or Harry Potter as they would both be born in July. He feared Harry Potter more because Harry was a half-Blood, like Voldemort himself. And so he decided to kill Harry Potter at the age of one year old. However this led to the first downfall of the dark lord when Lily Potter gave her life for her son.</p>
			<p>Voldemort, like all bad tryants in the history, live with a fear that there might be someone out there who is stronger and more powerful and will rise to topple him. Voldemort decided to murder Harry Potter after learning about the prophecy that Severus Snape overheard while spying on Dumbledore. The prophecy talked about someone who would be born to cause the Dark Lord’s demise and Voldemort wanted to nip that threat in the bud. In his haste to do that, he concluded that Harry would be the “chosen one” because he had a muggleborn mother, and started hunting them. He didn’t realize that he had “chosen” Harry to be the one who eliminated him in the end and making the prophecy come true.</p>

					<p>Hermione Jean Granger is a Muggle-born Gryffindor, who becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. She was born on 19 September 1979 and she was nearly twelve when she first attended Hogwarts. She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by J.K. Rowling as a "very logical, upright and good" character. J.K. Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but "very proud of her all the same." They are well aware of the wizarding world and have visited Diagon Alley with her. Hermione was originally intended to have a sister, but the planned sibling did not make an appearance in the first Harry Potter novel and, as Rowling noted, it "seemed too late" to introduce the character after all of that. Rowling confirmed in a 2004 interview that Hermione is an only child.</p>

					<p>According to Rowling, Ron was among the characters she created "the very first day." Ron is inspired by Rowling's best friend Sean Harris (to whom Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is dedicated), but she has clearly stated that she "never set out to describe Sean in Ron, but Ron has a Sean-ish turn of phrase." Like Harris is to Rowling, Ron is "always there" when Harry needs him. Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least in terms of magical power. However, he proves his bravery several times, such as by playing 'real wizard's chess' in the first book and entering into the Forbidden Forest with Harry during the second book despite his arachnophobia.

						Some of Ron's qualities serve as foils to Harry's. Whereas Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron comes from a loving but poor family. Many of his possessions are hand-me-downs.</p>

					<p>Draco serves as a foil to the hero, Harry Potter and is loosely based on bullies Rowling encountered during her school days. Harry first encounters Draco's snobbish bigotry after their initial encounter at Madam Malkin's. Rowling uses the Malfoys to introduce themes of intolerance and bigotry into a setting where people are often judged solely by their blood lineage rather than their good character or accomplishments. Draco, adhering to his family's beliefs, thinks that Muggle-born witches and wizards, which he and other characters derogatorily describe by the epithet Mudbloods, should be denied a magical education. Harry's first impression that the Wizarding community is a "magical wonderland" is instantly shattered. Says Rowling, "[Harry] found out that many people in power in the wizarding world are just as corrupt and nasty as they are in our world."</p>

					<p>In a 1999 interview, Rowling said Voldemort was invented as a nemesis for Harry Potter, and she intentionally did not flesh out Voldemort's backstory at first. "The basic idea [was that Harry] didn't know he was a wizard ... And so then I kind of worked backwards from that position to find out how that could be, that he wouldn't know what he was. ... When he was one year old, the most evil wizard for hundreds and hundreds of years attempted to kill him. He killed Harry's parents, and then he tried to kill Harry—he tried to curse him. ... Harry has to find out, before we find out. And—so—but for some mysterious reason the curse didn't work on Harry. So he's left with this lightning bolt-shaped scar on his forehead and the curse rebounded upon the evil wizard, who has been in hiding ever since."</p>

					<p>Rowling has stated that she enjoys writing Dumbledore because he "is the epitome of goodness." She said that Dumbledore speaks for her, as he "knows pretty much everything" about the Harry Potter universe. Rowling mentioned that Dumbledore regrets "that he has always had to be the one who knew, and who had the burden of knowing. And he would rather not know." As a mentor to the central character Harry Potter, "Dumbledore is a very wise man who knows that Harry is going to have to learn a few hard lessons to prepare him for what may be coming in his life. He allows Harry to get into what he wouldn't allow another pupil to do, and he also unwillingly permits Harry to confront things he’d rather protect him from." In a 1999 interview, Rowling stated that she imagined Dumbledore "more as a John Gielgud type, you know, quite elderly and – and quite stately." During his time as a student, Dumbledore was in Gryffindor House. Rowling said in an interview that Dumbledore was about 150 years old. However, on her website, she states that Dumbledore was born in 1881, making him either 115 or 116 at the time of his death.</p>
