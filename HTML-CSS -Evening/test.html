          There is a consensus of expert opinion that cricket may have been invented during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England. The first reference to cricket being played as an
                adult sport was in 1611, and in the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game. There is also the thought that cricket may have derived from bowls, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its
                target by hitting it away.

         Cricket has been played in the United States since the 18th century; the first formal clubs were formed in the 1820s. During the 1850s and 1860s, the popularity of cricket rivaled that of baseball. Later in the 19th century, American teams
                    sometimes competed against British and Canadian teams. A few players from this time in the sport’s history are regarded very highly.
                    While cricket is by far the most popular sport in the country, it is not the country's national sport. Hockey is India's National sport.sometimes competed against British and Canadian teams
                    a Twenty20
                    competition, which is also one of the biggest sports leagues in the world and the biggest cricket league in the world. The Indian cricket team is also accredited with the honour of winning all the ICC tournaments under MS Dhoni's captaincy.

          The roots of hockey are buried deep in antiquity. Historical records show that a crude form of the game was played in Egypt 4,000 years ago and in Ethiopia around 1,000BC, whilst an ancient form of the game was also played in Iran in around
                    2,000BC. However, Britain is credited with developing the modern form of field hockey. It was here that the first field hockey club was established in Blackheath, Ireland in 1861. The first association was formed in Britain in 1876.
                    A decade later, 9 international member clubs formed the first permanent association.

          The introduction of Hockey in the 1908 London Olympics with France, Germany and the four United Kingdom nations participating. Since then, it had an on-and-off journey until 1924, when it was held in 1920 Antwerp Olympics squeezed between
                    omissions in Stockholm (1912) and Paris (1924). Since then, it has been a regular feature in the Olympics. Women’s hockey was first featured in Moscow in 1980.
                    in 1945. However, the six years of war also meant that there wouldn’t be any Olympics for eight years. This also meant a sad end of careers for some of hockey’s most legendary players like Dhyan Chand, Roop Singh, and Carlyle Tapsell.

          Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization,
                    which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from
                    the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited
                    handling of the ball and others did not.Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, from official football playing fields

          In the winter of 1895,in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton, as a pastime to be played (preferably)
                    indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of its characteristics from other sports such as tennis and handball.Another indoor sport, basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen
                    kilometres) away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.

          Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players
                    per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or on a beach; formal games are played on a rectangular indoor court.

          Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock has struck the floor or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their absence) the opposing side.The shuttlecock
                    is a feathered or (in informal matches) plastic projectile which flies differently from the balls used in many other sports. In particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly.
