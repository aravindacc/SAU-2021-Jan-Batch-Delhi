            HONG KONG — In a high-pro-file attack on free speech and dis-sent in Hong Kong, the police on Monday arrested Jimmy Lai, a prominent pro-democracy media tycoon, and raided the offices of his    newspaper, demonstrating China’s resolve to silence the op-position and bring the city to heel.<br> The arrest was part of a striking crackdown against critics and de-moray advocates by Beijing and the allied government in Hong Kong, in the six weeks since China adopted a sweeping new national security   law.   And   it   validated fears that the authorities would make aggressive use of the law to smother the territories freewheel-in press and political culture.<br> “It  just  gives  the  lie  to  any  as-surances that the national securi-ty law would just target a few peo-ple involved in rioting,” said KeithRichburg,  director  of  the  Univer-sity  of  Hong  Kong’s  journalismschool.  “It’s  put  a  chilling  effectover everything here.”<br> Mr. Lai and his media company,long a thorn in the side of the Chi-nese Communist Party, supportedthe  antigovernment,  pro-democ-racy protests that gripped the citylast  year.  On  Monday,  police  offi-cers led him out of his mansion inhandcuffs  and,  hours  later,  morethan  200  officers  filed  into  thenewsroom  of  his  newspaper,  Ap-ple    Daily,    and    rifled    throughdesks.<br> Some   Apple   Daily   reporterslivestreamed   video   of   the   raid,documenting a story unfolding intheir   own   offices,   while   otherslooked   on   in   stunned   silence.When one asked Mr. Lai about thearrest  and  the  raid,  he  repliedgruffly, “How should I think aboutit, dude?”<br> The   police   also   arrested   Mr.Lai’s  two  sons,  who  are  not  in-volved in his media business, andfour executives from his company,Next  Digital,  including  its  chiefexecutive, Cheung Kim-hung.<br> Since  the  security  law  took  ef-fect,  the  Hong  Kong  authoritieshave  arrested  people  for  T-shirtsand  tweets  that  were  seen  as  ad-vocating      independence      fromChina,  have  asserted  a  right  toprosecute   critics   abroad,   havebarred  12  pro-democracy  candi-dates   from   legislative   electionsand  have  postponed  those  elec-tions by a year.<br> Those moves, like the arrest of Mr. Lai, signaled that China means to deal with Hong Kong as<br>

                Five years ago, this month, a push to unionize college football players ended in defeat. <br> But with the coronavirus pandemic raging so widely that fall sports seasons had become im-periled, college football’s stars on Monday mounted a ferocious pub-lick   campaign   to   salvage   their games — and to assert power in a multi billion-dollar industry. <br> The   organization, speed   and reach of the pressure campaign suggested that student-athletes, many of them already engaged in an off-season of activism around racial   and   systemic   injustices, were mastering and embracing bold public strategies that could eventually remake the relationship between universities and the people who play sports for them for little more than scholarships.<br> University administrators and coaches   have   spent   the   years since the unionization effort failed in 2015 watching the relative powfearlessness    of    college    athletes come under scrutiny on Capitol Hill and in America’s statehouses. And while it is not yet clear what the merged #WeWantToPlay what the    campaigns    will accomplish, college sports leaders think they have little choice but to notice and, in some cases, stand alongside the players.<br> “Players just want to be heard,        Continued on Page A21

        WASHINGTON — Governors across the United States struggled on Monday with how to makegood on President Trump’s order that their economically battered states deliver billions more in un-employment   benefits   to   jobless residents. <br> Democrats were harshly critical of Mr. Trump’s order, which he signed on Saturday night after talks with Congress on a broad new pandemic aid package col-lapsed. But even Republican gov-errors said the order could put a serious strain on their budgets and worried it would take weeks for tens of millions of unemployed Americans   to   begin   seeing   the benefit. <br> Congress   initially   provided   a$600-a-week supplement to un-employment benefits when the co-rotavirus   pandemic   shut   down much   of   the   United   States   in March. But that benefit lapsed on July 31, after talks between the White House and Congress broke down. Republicans had pushed fora    $400    supplemental    benefit, Democrats said it was not enough, and so on Saturday Mr. Trump or-dared the $400 benefit — but said it   was   contingent   on   states   to come up with $100 of that on their own. <br> Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York told reporters on Monday that Mr.  Trump’s directive would cost his state about $4 billion by the end of the year, making it Littlemore than a fantasy. He said that no   New   Yorker   would   see   enhanced   unemployment   benefits because of the president. <br> “This only makes a bad situation   worse,” Mr.   Cuomo   said. “When you are in a hole, stop dig-ging.  This executive order only digs the hole deeper.” <br> His comments were echoed bovo. Andy Besmear of Kentucky, a Democrat like Mr.  Cuomo, who said Mr. Trump’s order would cost his state $1.5 billion through the end of the year. <br> “It’s not workable in its current form,” Mr.   Besmear   said.   “It’s something virtually no state can afford. <br> Republicans largely praised the president for trying to act where Congress’s dysfunction had failed, but they said they would need to pull   funds   from   other   pressing budgetary needs. <br> Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican, said it was possible to comply with Mr.  Trump’s executive   order, but   he   would have to reallocate money from an-an-another portion of the budget.

Two people were shot and at least 13 police officers were injured.
