            <p>New Delhi : India could have access to at least 40 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine ready to ship from Serum Institute of India (SII) facilities in Pune, potentially helping the country catch up with other nations that have begun vaccinating their citizens.</p>

                <p>The vaccine is at present the only candidate that will be readily available in mass volumes for the country, but its stockpiles may be among the largest, SII executives have said in recent days. This, coupled with the vaccine’s compatibility with the Indian cold chain network are factors that could help a quick roll-out. P8</p>

            <p>New Delhi : As India gears up to launch world’s largest immunisation drive, the government is conducting a dry run on Saturday to assess its ability and readiness to administer shots to hundreds of millions of people, including many in remote corners of the country.

                The Centre has already successfully conducted a two-day pilot Covid-19 vaccination drive in eight districts in four states on December 28-29, but Saturday’s dry run is more ambitious in scope, covering all state capitals, with some states also testing the process’ efficiency in districts located in difficult terrain or which are poorly connected.
                
                In the national Capital, the drive will be conducted at three locations – the Daryaganj primary health centre, the government-run Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, and the private Venkateshwara hospital.
                
                Twenty-five beneficiaries – all health care workers – will be present at each site and the vaccination team will demonstrate how they will be registered, how vaccines will be given, and how they will be monitored for adverse events, if any.
                
                Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said, “The objective of this dry run is to prepare everyone for the huge immunisation drive.” A senior health ministry official said, “The dry run is to look at any gaps that may be seen on ground while executing the plan.” P8</p></div>
