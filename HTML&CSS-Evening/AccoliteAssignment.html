                            <p><b>In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had promised an indigenous vaccine as early as mid-August,
                                 a claim the government and its apex medical research body has since walked back.</b></p>

                            <p>
                                A vaccine for the coronavirus will likely be ready by early 2021 but rolling it out safely across India’s 1.3 billion
                                 people will be the country’s biggest challenge in fighting its surging epidemic, a leading vaccine scientist told Bloomberg.</p>

                            <p>India, which is host to some of the front-runner vaccine clinical trials, currently has no local infrastructure in place to go beyond immunizing babies and pregnant women, said Gagandeep Kang, professor of microbiology at the Vellore-based Christian Medical 
                                College and a member of the WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety.</p>

                            <p>The timing of the vaccine is a contentious subject around the world. In the U.S., President Donald Trump has contradicted a
                             top administration health expert by saying a vaccine would be available by October. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s
                             government had promised an indigenous vaccine as early as mid-August, a claim the government and its apex medical research body
                              has since walked back.
                            </p>

                            <p>For a country of its size, and with a virus curve that shows no sign of flattening, a safe and quick vaccine is a top priority
                                 for the Modi administration. The country’s broken health-care system, already struggling to deliver adequate care before the
                                  outbreak, cannot cope with the strain of a prolonged pandemic. A strict lockdown implemented in late March led to the biggest
                                   contraction among major economies with gross domestic product shrinking 23.9% in the three months to June from a year earlier.
                            </p>

                            <p>“By year-end we will have data that will tell us which vaccines are working and which ones are not going to do so well,” said Kang, who until July was heading the Indian government committee looking into prospective indigenous vaccine candidates.
                                 “If we get good results by year-end then we are looking at vaccines being potentially available in tiny numbers in first half of 2021 
                                 and larger numbers in the latter part.”</p>

                             Shardul took three wickets with the ball in Australia's first innings and then top-scored for India with a 67 as he got involved with Washington Sundar (62) in a fine rear-guard fightback to keep India in contention.</p>
